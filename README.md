Simple EEG prossesing using matlab
In general, EEG recordings can be divided into two categories: non-invasive EEG recordings obtained from electrodes attached to the scalp surface and invasive EEG recorded from electrodes implanted inside the cranium. Since implanted electrodes in invasive EEG are closer to the brain than scalp electrodes, they can record the brain signals with higher amplitudes and smaller spatial scales ranging from a single neuron cell to distributed cell groups. Additionally, it is assumed that invasive EEG recording does not suffer from major artefacts that compromise non-invasive EEG, such as eye blinks. However, invasive EEG suffers from some technical difficulties and have significant clinical risks; because recording electrodes are implanted in the cortex and are required to function well for a long time, there is a risk of infections and other damage to the brain.
Many studies have shown that although non-invasive EEG is less accurate in comparison with invasive EEG, it still contains enough real-time information to be used as a source for different applications and even in real-time brain computer interface (BCI) machines oriented to tasks such as word processing, Internet browsing or controlling a two-dimensional movement.
